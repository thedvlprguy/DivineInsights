# How to Build Zenmap

This document provides a structured breakdown of how to build the **Zenmap Network Scanner**, a powerful tool used for discovering vulnerabilities, scanning networks, and identifying devices in your network.

## Project Overview
- **What is Zenmap?**: Zenmap is the official graphical user interface (GUI) for **Nmap**, a widely used open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing. Zenmap provides an easy-to-use interface for performing network scans, discovering hosts, and identifying vulnerabilities across networks.
- **Why Zenmap?**: Zenmap simplifies Nmap's usage and adds advanced features like visualization of network topography, scan results comparison, and scanning history. It is ideal for IT professionals, network administrators, and security experts who need detailed network assessments.

## Setup & Installation
### 1. **Clone the Repository**
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nmap/zenmap.git
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies (Python + Nmap)**
Zenmap relies on **Python** and the **Nmap** library. To install the necessary dependencies, use:
```bash
cd zenmap
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Run Zenmap**
Run Zenmap by executing the following:
```bash
python zenmap.py
```
This command launches Zenmap’s graphical interface, allowing you to start scanning and analyzing networks right away.

## Backend Setup (Nmap Integration)
Zenmap interacts with **Nmap**, a powerful network scanner. The backend uses **Nmap’s command-line interface** to perform network scans, such as discovering hosts and mapping open ports.

### 1. **Install Nmap**
If you don’t have **Nmap** installed, you can install it by following the instructions here: [Nmap installation guide](https://nmap.org/book/install.html).

### 2. **Run Nmap via Zenmap**
Once installed, Zenmap can use **Nmap** for performing network scans directly. Select scan types and options from the GUI, and Zenmap will generate the corresponding Nmap command and execute it for you.

## API & Feature Configuration
Zenmap doesn't directly provide API integrations, but it facilitates many essential features related to network scanning and vulnerability identification.

### 1. **Nmap Scanning Profiles**
Zenmap comes with various scanning profiles like **Quick Scan**, **Intense Scan**, and **Ping Scan**. These profiles are designed to cater to different network discovery and vulnerability scanning needs.

### 2. **Custom Scan Command**
In Zenmap, you can create and run custom **Nmap scan commands** by adjusting parameters in the GUI. These include host discovery, port scanning, OS detection, version detection, and script scanning.

### 3. **Results Visualization**
Zenmap allows users to visualize scan results through:
- **Graphical Network Topology**: Displays a graphical map of the network, showing how devices are connected.
- **Comparison of Scans**: Compare multiple scan results to detect changes and assess vulnerabilities.

## Key Features of Zenmap
1. **Network Discovery**: Identify live hosts and open ports on the network.
2. **Port Scanning**: Find open ports and services running on devices.
3. **Operating System Detection**: Determine the OS of remote systems.
4. **Vulnerability Detection**: Identify security vulnerabilities by scanning for known issues using **Nmap scripts**.
5. **Scan Results Visualization**: View network layout and device connections graphically.
6. **Scan History & Comparison**: Track network changes over time by comparing historical scans.

## Contributing to Zenmap
We welcome contributions to **Zenmap**! If you want to contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a Pull Request with a detailed description of your changes.
